# The CIA Triad - a fundamental security model in information security
It defines three core principles for protecting data:
### 1. Confidentiality-
Ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals. This prevents unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive data. Examples include encryption, access controls, passwords, and authentication methods.    
### 2. Integrity-
Ensures that information remains accurate, complete, and unaltered by unauthorized parties. This protects data from improper modification or deletion. Examples include checksums, hashing, digital signatures, and version control.
### 3. Availability-
Ensures that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed. This means preventing disruptions to services and maintaining uptime. Examples include redundancy, backups, disaster recovery plans, and DDoS protection.    

### Key Points

These three principles work together and must be balanced based on organizational needs
Different situations may prioritize different elements (e.g., medical records prioritize confidentiality, financial transactions prioritize integrity, emergency services prioritize availability)
Most security measures and policies are designed to protect one or more of these three aspects
Threats to security typically target one or more elements of the CIA Triad

The CIA Triad serves as a framework for evaluating security risks, designing security policies, and implementing protective measures across IT systems and information management.
