# Attack Surface
The attack surface is the totality of all the possible points where an unauthorized user could try to enter data into or extract data from your system. Essentially, it's all the ways an attacker might try to compromise your system.

## Examples of attack surface components:
- Open ports
- User input fields and forms (doing stuff like sql injections)
- Authentication mechanisms
- Social engineering leaks through people

## Reducing attack surface:
- Disable unnecessary services and features
- Close unused ports
- Remove unnecessary code and dependencies
- Implement least privilege (users only get the access they need)
- Use firewalls to restrict network access
