# Reading contents of a file whose name contains spaces
- We can use double quotes to enclose the file path, to tell the command that we are passing a continuous sequence of characters (string)    
> [!NOTE]
> We have to use './' before the filename to provide the full relative path within the double quotes    
### Linux command:
```cat "./--spaces in this filename--"```
