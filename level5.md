# Accessing file type and language written
### Linux commands:
- ```cd inhere```
- ```ls -a```

  ```-file01  -file02  -file03  -file04  -file05  -file06  -file07  -file08  -file09```
- ```file -i "-file*"```
  - The 'file' command in linux is used to give information about the file content type and language.
  - The '*' glob is used to tell the system to replace itself with any sequence of characters found in the filenames that match the filename passed excluding the *
  - '-i' is an argument used along with 'file' command, used to tell the command to list the MIME type string of the file.
  - Command prints filenames along with their file type and text. Text is us-ascii for file_07 and binary for others, indicating that only file_07 is human-readable.
