# Viewing and accessing hidden files
### Linux commands needed:
1. ```ls -a inhere```  
   - Tells the system to list all files in the directory named 'inhere'.  
   - '-a' parameter, when used with 'ls' command means 'all'. So, it means 'list all'.
   - This prints: ```.  ..  ...Hiding-From-You```
2. ```cat inhere/...Hiding-From-You```
